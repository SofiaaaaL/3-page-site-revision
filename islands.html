        <h3>Impacts on the islands?</h3>
        <p>Sea level rise is complex, and will not impact small island states uniformly: oceans are expected to rise at different rates in different parts of the world, and the effects of any rise will depend on other conditions specific to the island (for example, the health of mangrove forests or coral reefs which can protect against erosion). However, some impacts of sea level rise are very likely to affect small island states generally, including higher risk of erosion, and more frequent and severe flooding of low-lying and coastal areas.</p>

        <h3>Any solution?</h3>
        <p>Sea level rise solutions can save communities and habitats, but they take time to implement.</p>
        <p>As sea levels continue to rise and cause problems for individuals and businesses, more and more concerned citizens are calling for their local politicians to take action. Many might already be aware of how community actions can lower flood insurance premiums — but what exactly are these “actions” and how long do they take to execute?</p>
        <p>Here are some solutions:</p>

            <p><strong>Building Seawalls</strong></p>
            <p>One solution that cities employ to decrease flooding from tides and storms is constructing seawalls. These barriers are often built to a height of five to six feet above sea level and cost approximately $600 to $2,000 per linear foot. When seawalls age or become damaged from constant exposure to saltwater or the impact of waves, they need to be replaced. They also need to be replaced or built higher as sea levels continue to rise.</p>
            <p>Time to execute: 4–5 years</p>

          <div class="solution-info">
            <p><strong>Using Beaches As Barriers</strong></p>
            <p>Similar to seawalls, beaches and dunes can act as a natural wall and reduce the impact of storm surge. The bigger the beach or larger the dune, the more water can be stopped from reaching homes and roads. Towns can add sand to make beaches bigger or to prevent them from eroding. Using this type of natural infrastructure can protect against flooding while maintaining beaches for the community to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Time to execute: 12 weeks</p>

            <p><strong>Building Stormwater Pumps</strong></p>
            <p>With higher seas, water doesn’t drain out to the ocean as easily. Drainage systems are designed to channel excess rainwater from the streets and drain it into the sea, but the pressure from rising sea levels and higher tides can push too much water into these pipes, causing water to spill out into streets. Pumps can speed up the process of getting water out of the streets by vacuuming up the flood water and releasing it back into the sea.</p>
            <p>Time to execute: 2–5 years</p>
