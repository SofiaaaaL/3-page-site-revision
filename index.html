        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Sea level rise is an increase in the level of the world’s oceans due to the effects of global warming. Burning fossil fuels is one of the causes of global warming because it releases carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere. The oceans then absorb the majority of this heat. As water becomes warmer, it expands. This results in ocean levels rising worldwide.</p>
        <div class="def">
          <p class="def-p">Land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets, is greatly affected by global warming, as well. These reserves of ice are located in places like Greenland and Antarctica. Typically, they experience melt during the warmer months of the year and the ice is replenished in colder months. With the average year-round global temperatures rising, however, ice caps and glaciers are experiencing a disproportionate amount of melting at an accelerated rate. </p>
          <p class="def-p">Sea level rise poses a serious threat to coastal life around the world. Consequences include increased intensity of storm surges, flooding, and damage to coastal areas. In many cases, this is where large population centers are located, in addition to fragile wildlife habitats. Therefore, people may become displaced and will need to seek safer homes. Even life farther inland is threatened because rising seas can contaminate soil and groundwater with salt. </p>

        <h3>Contributions</h3>
        <p>The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: <strong>oceans expand</strong>, <strong>ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall</strong>, and <strong>glaciers at higher altitudes also melt</strong>. Sea level rise since the start of the 20th century has been dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) are expected to increase in the 21st century. </p>

        <h3>Impacts</h3>
        <p>We have all heard terrible stories about how the future will be devastated by a rise in sea levels. As global temperatures continue to rise, ice in the polar regions and glaciers will melt, dumping tons of extra water into the ocean. Warmer water temperatures will also lead the oceans to expand. These factors will cause sea levels to increase and swamp coastal areas all over the world.</p>
        <p>Although flooding is the obvious consequence of rising sea levels, there are plenty of other effects to consider — none of them good. Here are some of those effects you probably haven't thought about:</p>

              <p><strong>- It will contaminate our drinking water</strong></p>
              <p>As the rising sea crawls farther and farther up the shore, in many places it will seep into the freshwater sources in the ground that many coastal areas rely on for their drinking water. These underground water sources, called aquifers, are crucial springs of freshwater — in fact, groundwater accounts for most of the planet's freshwater. </p>

              <p><strong>- It will interfere with farming</strong></p>
              <p>Those same freshwater sources we use for drinking also supply the water we use for irrigation. The problems here are the same: The intruding sea could make these groundwater sources saltier. Saltwater can stunt or even kill crops, but creating freshwater from saltwater is a costly and unsustainable practice.</p>

              <p><strong>- It will threaten wildlife populations</strong></p>
              <p>Many forms of wildlife make their home on the beach. As the rising ocean erodes the shoreline and floods the areas in which coastal animals live, animals like shorebirds and sea turtles will suffer. Their delicate nests may be swept away by flooding, an especially big problem for endangered animals like sea turtles that can't afford to lose any offspring. </p>
